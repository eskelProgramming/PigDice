# Pig Dice
This repository is a class project. It is a simple version of a 
game of Pig Dice. 

## Pig Dice rules
There are two players who take turns rolling a dice. The turn 
ends when the player either rolls a 1, or choses to hold. 
If the player rolls a 1, they lose all points for the turn.
If the player holds, points for the turn are added to their 
total. The game ends when a player reaches over 100 points.

## Getting Started

### Installing TypeScript
- Download and install the LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- In the command line run this command exactly as shown `npm install -g typescript`

### Compiling TypeScript
To compile the TypeScript files with the watch option, run the following command: `tsc --watch`. Using the watch option only requires us to compile once each time the project is opened.
